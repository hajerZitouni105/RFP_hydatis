# Response_to_call_for_proposal:
 
 ## ABSTRACT
 
This project covers the development and implementation of an AI-based solution to automate
responses to Call for Proposals (CFP). The project leverages generative AI techniques,
particularly Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), few-shot learning, and the Gemini
Flash API. The goal was to streamline the proposal creation process by automating content
generation, allowing users to create custom, high-quality responses quickly and accurately.
The system was implemented using Python for backend processing and React.js for the user
interface, with data stored in a MongoDB database.

## Adapted Solution

We have developed an automated response solution for Requests for Proposals (RFPs) aimed at
addressing the challenges associated with traditional methods. Our system leverages advanced
technologies to automate the RFP response process. By utilizing customized criteria, such as
the type of proposal, the nature of the project, and the industry involved, our system can
automatically generate tailored responses that align with the requirements of each RFP.
This approach is grounded in clear and objective guidelines, enabling precise and consistent
analysis of the risk factors associated with each proposal.
A key feature of our RFP response solution is its in-depth analysis of the data collected
from various documents, including the Cahier des Clauses Administratives Particulières (CCAP),
Cahier des Clauses Techniques Particulières (CCTP), Règlement de Consultation (RC), and
documents from previous projects at Hydatis. This enables us to ensure that all necessary
components, such as the technical memo, the DUME (Document Unique de Marché Européen),
and the projet acte d’engagement (projetae), are included in the responses.
By synthesizing this wealth of information, our solution provides comprehensive and
relevant responses, addressing the specific needs and expectations of our clients.

## Requirement Extraction

The requirement extraction process involved analyzing the key documents related to each
project. The focus was on extracting relevant technical and administrative information that
would be used to generate responses for various proposal sections. These documents included:

**• Technical Specifications:**

– Context: This section details the project’s background, specifying the need for the
project, the client, and the working environment.

– Needs and Requirements: The requirements for the system or application, including
the features and services that need to be delivered, were identified here.

– Minimal Requirements: These include the basic system requirements that are
critical for testing, quality control, and defining the client’s responsibilities.

– Technical Stack: This information was spread throughout the document and
includes the programming languages, technologies, and environments required for
project implementation.

– Documents and Deliverables: The required documentation and deliverables,
such as reports or project artifacts, were gathered from various sections of the
document.

– Maintenance Phases: For projects involving ongoing maintenance, information
about different maintenance phases (preventive, adaptive, corrective, evolutive) was
extracted.

– Team Requirements: This section provided details about the roles, expertise, and
experience required for the project team.


**• Administrative Clauses:**

This document governs the legal and contractual obligations
of the project. From it, we extracted the following:

– Market Purpose and Scope: The objective and mission of the project were
outlined here.

– Contractual Components: Key elements that make up the contract, such as the
constituent parts, were identified.

– Governing Legislation: Information on the legislation governing the contract and
the applicable laws was included.

– Execution Conditions: Details on how the project must be carried out, including
timelines and execution standards.

– Financial Terms: This section included the total contract amount, the pricing
structure, and payment terms.

– Execution Deadlines: Specific deadlines for each project phase were noted.

– Guarantees and Sureties: This part outlined the guarantees required by the
contractor to ensure the project is completed satisfactorily.

– Contract Modifications: Information on how the contract may be amended or
modified during the project execution.

– Verification and Reception of Services: This section detailed how services
would be verified and received to ensure they meet contractual standards.

– Insurance Obligations: Information about the insurance requirements for the project.

– Delay Penalties: Penalties for late project delivery or execution failures were noted
here.

– Contract Termination Conditions: This outlined the conditions under which
the contract may be terminated.

– Dispute Resolution Procedures: Steps to resolve any legal or contractual disputes
that may arise.

– Risks or Missing Information: Any potential risks, missing information, or
unclear clauses were identified and flagged for resolution.

## Model Selection and Prompt Engineering*

For text generation, we experimented with several models, including Mistral, Gamma2, and
Gemini Pro 1.5, before settling on Gemini Pro 1.5 for its performance and suitability for our
task. Gemini Pro 1.5 allows for cost-effective usage, with up to one million tokens of storage
per hour without additional fees.
Most of our focus was on prompt engineering, where we designed and refined prompts,
tested parameters to ensure accurate and contextually appropriate responses. This step was
crucial to avoid hallucinations, ensuring that the generated text aligned closely with the
extracted requirements.

## Text Generation with Retrieval-Augmented Generation(RAG)

We implemented the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technique for generating responses.
This process involved three key phases:

• Ingestion Phase:Data from previous projects and documents (CCTP, CCAP, RC) were
collected and indexed for efficient retrieval.

• Retrieval Phase: Using a similarity search mechanism, the system retrieved relevant
documents or sections matching the current proposal’s requirements.

• Generation Phase: Finally, the retrieved information was used to generate specific
sections of the Mémoire Techniques, DUME, and Projet AE. This approach ensured the
responses were accurate and contextually relevant.

## MongoDB Database Integration

We utilized MongoDB to store both the extracted data from previous projects and the generated
text. This database allowed us to efficiently query and retrieve relevant documents during the
retrieval phase.

## Front-end and Back-end Implementation

The application was implemented using Flask for the back-end and React.js for the front-end.
Flask handled API requests and integrated with Gemini Pro 1.5 for text generation, while
React.js was responsible for the user interface, allowing users to input new documents and view
the generated responses.
